Welcome to the ChatGPT Debugging and Automation Project

This repository is part of a specialized module in our IT curriculum, focusing on innovative ways to integrate artificial intelligence into everyday coding practices. The project covers two pivotal aspects of software development: debugging and automation. By engaging with these tasks, you will enhance your problem-solving skills and learn how to leverage AI tools to improve code quality and productivity.

Objectives

Debugging

Goal: Understand the practical use of AI in identifying and solving coding errors.

Activities:

Diagnose and correct bugs in provided code samples.

Work across multiple programming languages to identify common pitfalls.

Automation

Goal: Learn how to automate repetitive coding tasks with the help of AI.

Activities:

Generate boilerplate code, documentation, and basic unit tests.

Free up time to focus on complex and creative aspects of software development.

Outcomes

Enhanced Debugging Skills:

Confidence in troubleshooting and refining code.

Improved ability to articulate problems clearly and implement AI-driven solutions effectively.

Automation Proficiency:

Skills to leverage AI for automating coding tasks.

Improved efficiency and error-free coding practices.

Project Structure

This repository contains several tasks designed to practice debugging and automation skills:

0. Debugging - Python Factorial

Objective: Fix a Python script that calculates the factorial of a given number.

File: debugging/factorial.py

1. Debugging - Python Arguments

Objective: Correct a Python script to print only the program's arguments, excluding the script name.

File: debugging/print_arguments.py

2. Debugging - HTML/Javascript

Objective: Fix an HTML/JavaScript file so that a button changes the page's background color when clicked.

File: debugging/change_background.html

3. Debugging - Python Mines

Objective: Enhance a Minesweeper game script to detect when all non-mine cells are revealed, declaring a win.

File: debugging/mines.py

4. Documentation - Python Factorial

Objective: Add detailed comments to a Python script implementing a recursive factorial function.

File: debugging/factorial_recursive.py

5. Error Handling - Python Checkbook

Objective: Add error-handling features to a checkbook management script, ensuring robustness in user interactions.

File: debugging/checkbook.py
