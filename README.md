# Welcome to the ChatGPT Debugging and Automation Project

## Overview

This repository is part of a specialized module in the IT curriculum at Holberton School. It focuses on integrating artificial intelligence into software development practices, specifically in the areas of debugging and automation. Through this project, participants will enhance their problem-solving abilities and learn to leverage AI tools to improve code quality, efficiency, and productivity.

----------

## Objectives

### Debugging

**Goal**: Use AI tools to identify and solve coding errors effectively.  
**Activities**:

-   Diagnose and fix bugs in provided code samples.
-   Work across multiple programming languages to identify and address common pitfalls.

### Automation

**Goal**: Automate repetitive coding tasks with the help of AI.  
**Activities**:

-   Generate boilerplate code, documentation, and unit tests.
-   Focus on complex and creative aspects of development by reducing manual effort.

----------

## Outcomes

### Enhanced Debugging Skills

-   Develop confidence in troubleshooting and refining code.
-   Learn to clearly articulate problems and implement AI-assisted solutions.

### Automation Proficiency

-   Leverage AI for automating repetitive coding tasks.
-   Improve efficiency and establish error-free coding practices.

----------

## Project Structure

This repository includes tasks designed to practice debugging and automation:

### Debugging

1.  **Python Factorial**
    
    -   **Objective**: Fix a Python script that calculates the factorial of a given number.
    -   **File**: `debugging/factorial.py`
2.  **Python Arguments**
    
    -   **Objective**: Correct a Python script to print only the program's arguments (excluding the script name).
    -   **File**: `debugging/print_arguments.py`
3.  **HTML/JavaScript**
    
    -   **Objective**: Fix an HTML/JavaScript file to ensure a button changes the page's background color when clicked.
    -   **File**: `debugging/change_background.html`
4.  **Python Minesweeper**
    
    -   **Objective**: Improve a Minesweeper game script to detect when all non-mine cells are revealed, declaring a win.
    -   **File**: `debugging/mines.py`
5.  **Documentation - Python Factorial**
    
    -   **Objective**: Add detailed comments to a Python script implementing a recursive factorial function.
    -   **File**: `debugging/factorial_recursive.py`
6.  **Error Handling - Python Checkbook**
    
    -   **Objective**: Add robust error-handling features to a checkbook management script to ensure smooth user interactions.
    -   **File**: `debugging/checkbook.py`

----------

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com//holbertonschool-chatgpt-introduction.git  
```

2. **Navigate to the task directory**:
```bash
cd debugging  
```

3. **Run the Code**:
    
    -   Follow the instructions provided in each file to execute and test the tasks.

4. **Fix and Document**:
    
    -   Use ChatGPT to debug errors and generate solutions.
    -   Document your corrections and improvements directly within the scripts.
